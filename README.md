# CREATING NODE API W/ EXPRESS AND MONGO ATLAS

In this project I practiced my backend skills with nodeJS. This project was based on Matheus Battisti youtube tutorial.

This application can do all four CRUD operations straight to database which was choose MongoDB with mongoose.

To check routes it was use postman. Finally, to protect sensitive data it was use .env file.

So, to use this repository change file settings .env to your personal data.
